    Day 60. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's been two weeks. Hello there.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's been fun these past two weeks. I've spoken with interesting
    and inspiring people, I went on an adventure, and of course, there
    was halloween. Halloween isn't really a Chinese thing, but
    everybody sees the fun in dressing up and spooking each other, so,
    at least in areas with lots of foreigners, you'll see costumes
    and decorations just like in the states.
  </p>
  <p>
    Did I mention I went on an adventure? I escaped the city for the
    first time since arriving here, and took a trip to the neighboring
    city of Tianjin. At the very last minute, the Hostel was booked,
    the train tickets were procured, and me and my roommate Adam were
    off. An interesting thing to note - the trip from my university to
    the Beijing train station takes longer than the trip from Beijing
    to Tianjin! By bullet train, traveling at a brisk 300km/h the trip
    between the two giant cities takes just 30 minutes. The tickets
    were about $9 each. The ride was comfortable.
  </p>
  <p>
    We arrived, and immediately confronted our mutual unpreparadness -
    we had no itinerary, a rough idea of what attractions Tianjin
    offers, and no clue how public transportation works here. We had
    our eye on The Eye, the large Ferris Wheel that spans the width of
    a river in downtown Tianjin, and we decided to taxi over there
    first. Adam and I were happy to keep our minds and eyes open, for
    cool things to do along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Near the ferris wheel (which we never actually ended up riding) we
    happened upon a busy and happining area filled to the brim with
    stands selling all manner of things, alleys lined with food,
    clothing, toys, you name it. We kept walking through the sea of
    people, and the shops continued, alley after alley, and we walked
    until we were too tired to continue. This was our first encounter
    with Tianjin serendipity - it truly felt like there was another
    surprise around each corner.
  </p>
  <p>
    After some struggle communicating with Taxi drivers, we managed to
    get a ride to our hostel, to set down our bags and check in. We
    stayed at the Tianjin Cloudy Bay hostel. As this was our first
    trip outside of Beijing, we had no idea what to expect - I had
    never stayed at a hostel before and was anxious to see what it's
    like. We walked down Ha'er'bin Street and kept our eyes out for
    it. Then, to our right, we passed a rainbow colored staircase. We
    doubled back and looked - there was the sign "Cloudy Bay". This
    was ours. Ascending the staircase, we opened the door, and met
    with the opening to a super hip bar - smartly dressed students on
    laptops, funky and unique interior design, and a foosball table for extra
    flair. We saw our bedroom, which was a comfortable dorm-style
    arrangement, 6 beds per room; and after we put down our bags, we
    immediately went up the stairs to check out the roof, which was
    similarly wall designed, hip, and picturesque. For 80 Yuan per bed,
    the equivalent of roughly $13 USD, we were pleased.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our day continued, and we visited and bumped into other cool
    places - we accidentally walked past a house made of vases and
    repurposed damaged pottery, and decided to pay the entrance fee to
    take a tour. We went to three different places for dinner, getting
    a variety of distinct styles of food. On our way back to the
    hostel, we accidentally found Bin Jiang Dao, a gigantic upscale
    commerical street, teeming with activity. There, we stopped for a
    minute to eat some ice cream, and saw some passersby sipping on
    drinks that glowed neon colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though we only stayed one day in the city, and left soon after
    waking the next morning, Tianjin left a good taste in my mouth, as
    it seemed to will me to experience the things that it had to
    offer. My favorite thing may have been just after we had returned
    to the hostel, before we went out for the night. We were chatting
    up the Hosteliers in our broken Chinese, and managed to conscript
    one of them and another guest into a game of foosball. It was a nice
    crosscultural experience, as competition spans the boundary of
    language. These people were strangers to me, and yet, we shared
    that moment. Coming, going, or just showing up for work, our lives
    were all pointed in different directions; but for a wink of time,
    as fate would have it, we were there together.
