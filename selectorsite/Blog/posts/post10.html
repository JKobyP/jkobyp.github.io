    Day 45. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing particularly exciting happened this week, so I'll use this
    post to bring you all up to speed with what's been going on - I've
    been sharing some vingnettes and ideas with you all, but I haven't
    shared certain crucial details regarding school, my living
    conditions, making friends, etc.
  </p>
   <h5>School.</h5>
  <p>
    So, here we are in China on day 45. Wow the time has just flown
    by. Anyway, we started our classes about a month ago on September
    14th. I'm studying within the department of Chinese as a Second
    Language, and therefore, the majority of my class time is spent in
    my two core classes - Chinese, and Spoken Chinese. Those two
    classes make up 14 hours of my week, spent with my 12 fellow
    classmates, who are all great people. Additionally, I'm taking a
    Chinese Writing Composition elective, and a Listening
    Comprehension elective. This is all at the intermediate level.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I said, I spend 14 hours a week with a class of 12 upstanding
    students, hailing from the US, Germany, the Philippines, New
    Zealand, Ukraine, Spain, Scotland, and Japan. Occasionally, we
    attempt to organize social excursions outside of class, which meet
    with varying degrees of success. We come from many different
    backgrounds, and as such, we all have something to bring to the
    table. Alex came to study Chinese after a couple of years working
    as an engineer - when he's done, he's thinking of finding work in
    London for a year or two. Scott is the enthusiastic class-leader,
    and when he graduates, he wants to change the way companies do
    business with China. Hannah has moved around a lot, and is a bona
    fide German, Australian, and French. Kyle studies Network Science
    at Westpoint. There a quite a few foreigners in Beijing, but you
    can bet that any given one will have a unique reason for being there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teacher Yu and Teacher Zhang are also excellent people to spend 14
    hours per week with. Admittedly, Teacher Yu's lectures put me to
    sleep sometimes, but I'm learning a lot and the pace is right in
    the sweet spot - challenging but definitely doable. Zhang Laoshi's
    class is a bit more interesting - it is the speaking class, so we
    do much more partner-work, and the class is overall more
    interactive, so you really can't fall asleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are dictations. Chinese is a unique language for many
    reasons, one of which being its lack of alphabet! A few times per
    week, we are given dictations - character quizzes. The teacher
    will say a word, and we will have to write it down properly in
    order to get credit. This is what the majority of my independent
    study time is spent doing - memorizing characters, one flashcard
    at a time. Sometimes memorizing a word is just putting together
    two character that I already know - like 亲近 (qinjin, to get
    close) which I'm studying for this week. Other times, I have to
    learn the strokes for characters I've never seen before, like for
    喧嚣 (xuanxiao, noisey). 
  </p>
    <h5>Life.</h5>
  <p>
    I sleep in a really comfortable dormitory, which I share with my
    Australian roommate, Adam. Our dorm room is at least twice the
    size of the double I lived in back at Case, and contains a sink
    and a water-heater, as well as a small television which plays a
    number of Chinese channels. The bathrooms and showers are shared
    with the rest of the floor, and there is a small "kitchen"
    outfitted with a microwave and a hot-plate. Lately, I've been
    spending a bit of time in there, experimenting with a new
    steaming-rack I bought. I hope to get more creative as the
    semester continues, and return with all sorts of Chinese
    cooking prowess. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam and I have pretty different personalities, but we get along
    pretty well, and our humor is pretty compatible - when he told me
    that he's a fan of Community, I knew I was in the right place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I typically save forays into the city for the weekends, but during
    the week I've started going to a couple of martial arts clubs.
    I've begun going to a lecture series from the Western Student
    Union on Wednesdays, which brings in notable speakers. I often
    find some-or-another objective for an odd afternoon. Usually, it's
    to purchase some or another item I may need for my dorm, or go to
    a place near campus that I haven't been to yet. It's not always
    easy to balance -- I want to go out and experience Beijing, but I
    also want to stay in and study for my classes, and I also want to
    continue doing some programming to keep my skills sharp.
  </p>
  <p>
    So that's it, folks, my daily life in a nutshell. Not terribly
    unlike any University student's, save for the fact that 99% of the
    people I walk past on the street are Chinese.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>P.S.:</b> Yes, the smog is as bad as the media makes it seem. It's
    pretty random - we'll often have several consecutive beautiful
    days. Immaculately blue skies, crisp fresh air, invigorating breeze.
    Then, occasionally, there'll be a couple of days with AQI over 300. On these days,
    the sun is obscured. At night, the bright billboards illuminate the
    hanging fog to cast a colorful glow over the street. The
    decreased visibility warps the city's proportions, making your
    surroundings seem at once bigger and also smaller than you know
    them to be. When walking around campus on these days, you see a
    lot of masks - but you also see people without masks. Daily life
    continues. So it goes.
