	<p>It feels... deceptive to title this post as I have. I have been
	  walking this path for about 4 months, now. Last February, as I scrambled
	  to get the Chinese government the documents they needed, that was the
	  start of my journey.
	</p><p>
	  I was given a unique opportunity - to study abroad in Beijing with a
	  full scholarship, courtesy of the Chinese government. The catch? I had
	  two weeks to put the paperwork together. The other catch? The Chinese
	  government isn't known for being particularly transparent, ie. good luck
	  getting clarification on anything. After a flurry of notaries, and a
	  number of instances of "I hope this is what they meant by..." I finally
	  finished the application process. I was free to wait for the response,
	  which I would receive in... July?! Are you kidding? I didn't even know
	  what my chances were -- Case has never even applied for this scholarship
	  before, and had absolutely nothing to go on. I'm not hanging my fate on
	  this until July.
	</p><p>
	  So, it was decided that I apply to Hong Kong Polytechnic University as
	  well. And after a much shorter and less stressful application process, I
	  waited about 4 weeks and... this morning I woke up and there it was -
	  the email that said: "your admission to the programme has been
	  approved."
	</p><p>
	  And now this is a thing -- not 99%, not "most-likely", but definitely a
	  thing! Whether or not Beijing accepts me in July, I'm going to China.
	  It's time to invite you to join me on my journey. We are starting down
	  this path.

          P.S. Shout out to Autumn Beechler for being a great Study Abroad
          Advisor! Without her, I don't know where I would be. </p>
