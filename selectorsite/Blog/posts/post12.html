    Day 80.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm gonna make this short, as I've got a midterm to study for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just wanted to check in and give ya'll a quick life update.
    I'm still alive and kicking, I took a spontaneous trip to
    Datong last weekend, and I woke up to a fresh blanket of snow
    this morning. Sorry for not writing more, folks, but I'll be
    home before you know it and I'm sure I'll just say it all again
    anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
    Datong had some really amazing sights. If all goes as planned,
    once my time here has come to an end, I'll throw some of the best
    photos and videos into a movie, and I'll post a link to it here.

    Thanks for reading.
