  <p>
    I'm here. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I got in yesterday. The plane ride was uneventful. We took an
    arctic route which was super exciting, flying through the north
    pole to get to China. I watched some movies. Sure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interesting part is getting off the plane. I stumbled my way
    through the airport, passing jaded customs officers and families
    eager to see distant relatives. I diffidently wandered around
    outside the airport, trying to determine how to get to where I
    needed to go. Without too much trouble, I found the ticket kiosk
    and mounted the bus. This was my first opportunity to sit calmly
    and take in my surroundings.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I sat staring at the window, my first thought was of the
    sky. It was blue. I was expecting it to be grey and smoggy. I felt
    cheated. Little did I know, the air quality on that day was
    strictly regulated by the government, because there was a national
    holiday. Traffic controls and controls on industry, I later
    learned, led to clear skies for my welcome to Beijing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once at the stop, I wandered around some
    more, walking for a few km and second guessing myself at each
    step. I found my hotel and resolved to stay there for the night -
    I was tired from my journey and in no mood to explore in the
    dark. So, at 9pm, as late as I could muster, I fell asleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I woke up to those grey skies I had been expecting.
    I took a campus tour, which apart from getting rained on, was
    quite nice! I met a
    Swede, Russian, Mexican, and Italian, as well as a couple of
    Japanese people and our Chinese tour guides. People were friendly
    and we all enjoyed lunch together at the end of the tour - this
    was my first Chinese meal in the country, and that was kind of
    cool. Our guides purchased two big bowls of stuff - don't even try
    asking me what it was called, but it was filled with meat of all
    shapes, sizes and types, and some vegetables and mushrooms. We
    each also had a bowl of rice. As we each stuck our chopsticks into
    the communal bowls of stuff, we conversed with each other in
    English and tried to break the ice. One among us, named Du Bian,
    was Japanese, and wasn't adept enough at English to contribute to
    the conversation, but he and I tried to get to know each other
    using Chinese to bridge the language gap. 
  </p>
  <p>
    By far the most notable cultural barrier for me in Beijing is the
    language. Because I'm so unfamiliar with life and norms here, I
    try to tread carefully - as a result, I've been  nervous much of
    the time on this first day. As I start to find a niche here, and
    get used to the rhythm, I'm sure this issues will fade. For now,
    however, I'm dealing with it by curling up in bed and eating a
    brownie left over from the airplane. I think that this coping
    mechanism is an effective one.
