	<p>So it happened. My decision has been made. The offer from Beijing arrived in my inbox
	  this morning. In the passenger seat of Dad's car as we traveled from South Carolina back
	  home, an email from Autumn Beechler appeared on my phone - I saw the text, "I'm extremely
	  excited to..." and put the rest together. It was exciting, to say the least.
	</p>
	<p>
	  And now my job is to tell people! And worry about Visas. And housing. But I prefer telling people,
	  so I'm doing more of that. The Visa and housing issues are solveable - I plan to talk to Autumn about
	  them soon. It's just a matter of doing what needs to be done. Then, I need to figure out:
	</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Who my point-person is in Beijing, so I can stop bothering poor Autumn with all my questions, and </li>
	    <li>How to make sure I'm taking the classes I should be taking.</li>
	  </ol>
	<p>
	  Worst to worst, I can't take any credits that count toward my CS requirements, and this acts as a sort-of
	  "gap semester." I will experience China immersively and fully, without worrying about computer science classes.
	  Normally, this would be unreasonable, but considering my program is free of charge, it's
	  definitely concievable. Ideally, though, I'd like to learn a bit of Computer Science. Regardless, I don't
	  think it'll come to this worst-case scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
	  So this is where I'm at. I'll try to keep you updated at milestones along the way.
	  Thank you for sticking with me, and we've only just begun. Soon, I think, the content
	  of these posts will change from "this is what I'm worried about" to "check out this
	  awesome thing I did!"
