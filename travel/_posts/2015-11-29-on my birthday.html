It's always really interesting to pass milestones in new and interesting
places. You learn a little bit about yourself and your situation by seeing
exactly how you pass it, and who you pass it with. For instance, this year
for Thanksgiving dinner, I ate a bowl with rice and pork (which was actually
delicious). I learned that, somewhat surprisingly, it's not really the food
that makes the holiday for me - if my family's not around, then it just can't
be Thanksgiving.

Plans for plans started popping up around my birthday - but what to do? Who
with? Where to do it? All these questions were simple more than I wanted to deal
with, so instead of worrying about them, I abandoned plan and joined the Hiking
Club for a treck up 黄草梁 (huang cao liang, roughly "Yellow Grass Ridge"). It
was a nice short hike with invigorating sites. We departed at 7AM sharp and
returned by 5pm. The mountain was really breathtaking.

I had a few hours to have dinner and recuperate. During this time I was visited
by my friend Valeria from upstairs, who very kindly gifted me some Belarusian
chocolate and other sweets. So now, obviously, I have to go to Minsk sometime
and return the favor.

That night, I had been invited by my friend Chrys out to what was described as
a "German Party." I had been hesitant to accept at first, because I wanted to
celebrate with some more of my friends than just Chrys and some other Germans, but
after scrapping the plan, I employed the taoist philosophical technique of going
with the flow, and just shipped off with Chrys and her friend Yvonne. When we
arrived at the party, it was... very different than we expected. In that there
were about 9 Chinese people to 1 German, and that it was just a handful of
people sitting around a table drinking warm spiced wine and playing drinking games.
Still - we were not about to let that stop us, and had a fun and laughter-filled
night.

Passing my birthday here reminded me that there are really all sorts of
opportunities to adventure and meet people here, but it also reminded me of my
friends and family back home whom I miss. I know I'm on the tail end of my
journey here, and I'm excited to come home and see all of you, but I'm
determined to make the most of what time I have left.

Happy holidays.
