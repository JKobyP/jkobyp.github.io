excerpt: I took a trip to Chengde. This took place two weekends ago, with
    co-conspirators Chrys, Adam, and Inyoung. Chengde is located about 250km to the
    northeast of Beijing, and it was just a short few hours on the bus before we
    arrived. The four of us were greeted by Chengde's intense cold

I'm proud to announce that the status of my checklist has changed:
<ol>
    <li> Eat stinky tofu </li>
    <li> Go to an arcade or internet cafe </li>
    <li><s> Check out Chengde </s></li>
    <li> Check out the 798 Art District </li>
    <li> Stay out way too late at the bar called Dada </li>
</ol>
Unfortunately however, I only have three weeks left and finals are intense! We
will see if I can finish out the remaining list items (and still pass my
classes)

As you can see, I took a trip to Chengde. This took place two weekends ago, with
co-conspirators Chrys, Adam, and Inyoung. Chengde is located about 250km to the
northeast of Beijing, and it was just a short few hours on the bus before we
arrived. The four of us were greeted by Chengde's intense cold - we stepped off
the bus expecting weather comparable to that of Beijing, but in fact the
temperature in Chengde was lower by around 10 degrees. Ostensibly, this is
caused by Chengde's location nestled in a range of mountains.

The city, we learned, houses a few million people. Its significance actually
lies in its coolness -- it served as the summer resort for the Qing
emperors of the 19th century. I'm also told that it's known for dried foods such
as fruit and jerky.

We were there for a short time, and only had time to visit the temple of
Guanying Pusa, honoring what I understood to be the female representation of
buddha, and the Ming dynasty Summer Resort. The Summer Resort itself was vast,
and we hardly had time to visit a tenth of it - but we made time, of course, to
rent a sleigh and push each other across sections of the frozen lake there. It
would be quite something to imagine such a place verdant and lush, such as we
would expect if we were to come in the summer months.

My favorite part of the trip was probably Saturday night. After wasting time
looking for Chengde's "re nao", trying to find a street we'd heard of that's
filled with people, food, and stuff, well, we ended up giving up and getting
dinner in the nearest restaurant. Not to be disappointed, we finished dinner and
went to a local bar - it was comfortable, stylish, and curiously empty. For a
few hours, we drank, snacked, played cards, and the four of us became closer.
That's the part of Chengde I look back on most fondly.

Join me next time, when I'll probably talk about Christmas or something!
