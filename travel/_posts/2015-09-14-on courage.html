    Since arriving here, food has been very, very important. Primarily
    it serves to satisfy hunger, but secondarily, it acts as an
    interface to the community. Not only does sharing a meal help me
    get to know my classmates, but the action serves as symbol for the
    culture as a whole. As it is said, 民以食为天, "To
    the people, food is as the heavens." As such, it is a useful
    measure of my acclimation to Beijing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Things began slowly. At my first forays into the local
    cuisine, I was lucky enough to be accompanied by experienced
    people - people whom I had just met, but started to
    befriend. My first time attempting to eat without their expertise,
    however, I was terrified. Our
    largest dining hall, called 农园 ("Nong Yuan"), was packed with
    people. I mean packed. The walls were lined with windows, each
    displaying different regional foods, hundreds of options to choose
    from. Hundreds of options, all of them unrecognizable, all of them
    unpronouncable. It was... stressful. But you've gotta eat, right?
    So what did I do? I looked until I saw something vaguely familiar,
    pointed at it and said 这个 ("zhe ge" or "this one"). The next
    thing I knew, I was sitting down to eat. It was green and had corn
    in it, and it tasted pretty good; that's all I could really tell you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gradually, the pointing method grew more comfortable, and served
    me well. That is, until today. I set out this afternoon for a
    Taiwanese pancake. There was a stand on campus that prepared these
    things to order, and I had seen people walking around with
    them. They always looked delicious - lightly fried dough wrapped around
    meat, vegetables, or whatever else you preferred. At times I would
    stand near the booth, observing locals ordering, watching the food
    cook, weighing whether or not to order one myself. In the moment,
    I always decided not to - there are several dining halls within a
    few meters, why even undergo the discomfort of ordering this new
    food? Today, however, I felt differently. I was determined not to
    return to my dormitory empty-handed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I arrived phone in hand, prepared to cross reference unfamiliar
    vocabulary from the posted menu onto my dictionary app. There were
    two people in front of me, which bought me time and provided valuable
    content for observation. I scanned the menu and determined
    necessary vocabulary - pancake, "shou zhua bing." Original flavor
    - "yuan wei". Now what questions would she ask me? I needed to
    make my order as simple as possible - fried egg, "jian dan." No
    meat - "bu yao rou." I rehearsed possible dialogues in my head, as
    I approached the window.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beijing's food workers, from my experience, speak hurriedly, and
    with a distinct Beijing accent. As a foreigner, this means I can
    usually stammer some words out, but can rarely understand any sort
    of comment or inquiry as response. I was wary of any questions the
    lady behind the counter would ask me, and
    tried to anticipate them beforehand. We got off to a bit of a
    rough start as I reached the counter and heard something
    completely unintelligible stumble out of the cook's
    lips.
  </p>
  <p>
    "shenme?" I asked - "what?" As she began to repeat herself,
    and my confusion became apparent, the student who had ordered in
    front of me kindly translated into clear Mandarin asking, "What
    would you like to eat?" Thanking her, I then replied to the cook,
    "bingzi!" or, "pancake!" A glance at the cook's face proved that
    my answer was not satisfactory. I pointed up at the menu,
    which was not easily in view from behind the counter, but
    eventually it was communicated - "shou zhua bing?" And she slapped
    a fresh circle of dough onto the griddle. My challenge continued
    as I pulled out my rehearsed vocabulary, and exercised my
    improvisational skills.  With a bit of educated
    guessing and some teamwork, I managed to walk a way with a
    delicious hand-held savory pancake, enclosing a fried egg, some
    greens, and a bit of spicy "la jiang" sauce. It tasted like success.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was so good I had to stop off the side of the road so I could
    concentrate on eating it slowly. As I leaned against a building,
    munching, watching Chinese faces, one after the other, passing in
    an endless stream, I had a moment to contemplate what I had
    just done. Too often in life, I am able to talk myself out of
    making the tough choice, justify taking the easier path. Reasons
    for inaction, propelled by fear, flow naturally to those who
    encounter opportunities to take courageous action. To conquer this
    false rationality, this innate flaw in the nature of humankind, is
    a triumph of the spirit. The courage it takes to do so releases
    the shackles of self-doubt, and liberates the heart.
