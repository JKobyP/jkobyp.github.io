    Today, my plane has finally been booked. It feels like the last thing I have
    to worry about has been taken care of - this feeling is a false one, there are
    plenty of things I can still worry about. Nevertheless, the security of a
    confirmed ticket does a lot to make this entire adventure more real. It gives
    a cold hard date and time to things. I'm glad it's done.

    At this point, I'm waiting on the visa service to process my application, deliver
    it to the proper authorities, and send all my stuff back to me. So that's out of my
    hands. The only thing left for me to do is pack, which I can't do all too much of
    30 days out; and plan, which I refuse to do all too much of 30 days out. The problem
    with planning, or attempting to plan, is that there are too many unknowns to plan
    effectively. Sure, I should make sure to be prepared with some spare cash and a few
    friends to call on, but I won't really know what it is that I need to do until I'm
    on the ground. So, trying to obsessively take control of the first couple of days in
    China is unrealistic at best, and psychologically harmful at worst. Better to just
    do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done.

    I have been given some great advice over the past few weeks, from those who have studied
    abroad before me, and from those who have grown up in Beijing or other parts of China.
    This advice has been invaluable to me in conquering the logistics and anxiety of going
    to a new place like this. One pearl of wisdom I have received that really helped me is
    this: when you are feeling stressed out, just relax, and go with it. I've realized the
    stress I feel regarding Peking and the lack of information I receive from them is a form
    of culture shock - I expect them to do things differently because I'm used to the way
    things have always been for me. If I understand that things work differently in China -
    and that things still inevitably <i>work</i>, in China (which they do, most of the time)
    then I have no reason to worry.

    Thanks to those of my friends that have given me advice and moral support at any point
    leading up to this. Thank you to my parents for helping me deal with paperwork, and for
    a million other things. To all of you readers out there, I leave September 2nd! And you
    can bet I'll be blogging from that 12 hour flight.
