I've been thinking about friendship a lot recently, as I toil at home in the weeks leading up
to my trip. I've been thinking about a lot of things, and friendship is one of those things.
I've been thinking.
</p>
<p>
I left highschool two years ago, left a number of people with whom I anticipated
losing touch.
I've lost touch with friends before, and felt little at the thought of losing touch with these
ones. "So it goes," I thought -- after all, I would keep in touch with those friends of mine
who warranted the stability of friendship. Time would filter out the noise in my life, and those
remaining were the friends worth having. On the whole, I still think this is not a bad way to think
about things. Still, I wish I would have recorded my hopes and expectations at that time, to
compare those predictions with my experience.
</p>
<p>
So as planned, I lost touch. Friends were filtered out of my life. I made new friends. And now
it's summertime, and I'm toiling. Now it's summertime, and I'm reaching out to old friends.
I'm getting lunch with them, seeing movies with them, and wondering whether our friendship means
something different now than it did before. It's lovely to catch up with old friends that you
haven't seen in a while, but sometimes... well, sometimes it just isn't. While sometimes catching
up with someone who knew the old you may help you clearly see the new you, sometimes "catching
up" can be a wake-up call, reminding, <i>there's a reason this person is no longer in your life.
Things are different now. Move on.</i> Sometimes "catching up" makes you question who your friends
even were, or whether you even had them. Whether you even <i> have </i> them.
</p>
<p>
I think friends are people that care about you and are there for you. Friends notice when you
need them, and will lend you their support. They satisfy a need, whether that be companionship
or baked goods. Friends are any or all of these things. Acquaintances that do not do these things
are distractions. Complex, conscious, often wonderful distractions, but distractions all the same.
Like alcohol or chocolate cake, they may allow us forget ourselves, and we should be conscious of how we
make use of them.
</p>
<p>
That's what I think. I'm curious to hear about your thoughts on friendship.
