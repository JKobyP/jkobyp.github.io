    Day 4.

  <p>
    These few days have been turbulent ones. Culture shock has often
    been described to me as a turbulent phenomenon - bouts of
    lonliness or frustration and periods of peaceful acceptance. It's
    something I'll likely be dealing with my entire semester here at
    北大 (Beida, shorthand for the name of my university), in its
    several stages.

  <p>
    One thing that has helped free me from the anxiety of starting at
    a new school, and the stresses of cultue shock, has been walking
    around the campus in the evenings. I've done this twice so far,
    and the solitary walks help clear my mind, while orienting me to
    the campus. Tonight, I had a rather simple objective - find a
    reusable water bottle at the campus market.

    Before I set off, I found the market on the map I was given at
    registration, and planned my route. I exited 中关新园 (Zhong'guan
    xin'yuan, the name of my dormitory complex) and I
    headed toward campus. Passing some street-vendors camped outside
    the southeast gate, I showed my campus card to enter, and began to
    walk towards what I so far consider to be the heart of campus -
    the Central Business District. It had been a beautiful blue day,
    and it was a nice warm evening. I navigated the streets nearly
    automatically, half from memory, and half by following the
    continuous surge of people in and out of the campus. As I walked
    near a group of students talking in Chinese, I tried to discern
    what they were discussing - something about the beautiful sky, and
    the splotches of color as the sun set.  At one point, I took a
    wrong turn, but instead of turning back, I chose to rely on my
    internal compass, and managed to come back around to my
    destination.

    The Central Business District, known also as the CBD, is a good
    indicator of the vastness of the miniature city that is
    campus. Walled on all four sides, the university is monitored by
    uniformed gatekeepers, who control access to the university -
    generally only those with
    campus cards may enter. The nothern section contains many of the humanities
    classrooms, and also beautiful greenery, centuries-old buildings,
    and the pristine Weiming lake. The southern section has a bit more
    cement - modern buildings vast and small, and wide, named
    roads. It was through the southern section that I traversed the
    hustle and bustle as I approached the CBD. The streets, now
    crowded, teemed with walking young adults, ladies sitting side-saddle
    on the backseats of bicycles, electric scooters whistling, announcing their
    presence, and the occasional truck. All of us shared the road, and
    yes, it is a miracle that we all managed to pass without
    collision. Yet, this is the way here; it doesn't work the same way
    as in the US, but still, somehow, it works.

    I arrived at Wumei, and descended the staircase to the underground
    market. I hadn't been there before, and was excited to see what
    mystery an underground market could hold. In the end, not very
    much. Think of it as a combinatio of your local CVS, and a typical
    university apparel shop. It didn't seem underground, it just
    seemed indoors.  Still, I came for a water-bottle, and I paid my
    19 kuai. At a conversion rate of about one sixth, a fitting
    price. I left the building feeling accomplished, and made my way
    back past the crowd, the fruit stands, the vendors selling their
    wares, the campus Subway, the glowing signs announcing 
    <span style="font-variant: small-caps">24-hour self-service
    banking</span>, over the bridge that serves as a crosswalk to
    protect from the irreverent drivers below. This city is now the
    city that I belong to. Its people, for me to learn from. Its land,
    for me to explore.
