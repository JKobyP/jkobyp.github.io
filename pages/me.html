<h1> Hi, I'm Koby </h1>
<br>
<p>
I'm a full stack engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am a habitual hobbyist and learner,
having dabbled in Mandarin, baking (esp. sourdough), rock climbing, juggling,
hacker history, and swing dance. I'm a vimmer and a devout archlinux
user. My favorite flavor of software is libre.
</p>
<p>
I'm also an official socialist organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America!
<a href="https://dsacleveland.org">Cleveland's chapter</a> is doing
some real cool stuff right now, don't hesitate to contact me about it.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see some of the software projects I've worked on, check out my <a

</br>
Particularly, <a href="https://github.com/timtadh/dynagrok"> dynagrok
</a> may be of
interest. It's an object-state profiler and object-state based
fault-localizer for Go. It has a number of other features as well.
