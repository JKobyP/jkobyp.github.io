<h1> Hi, I'm Koby </h1>
<br>
<p>
I'm a computer scientist at CWRU. I am interested in travel, sinology,
sourdough, rock climbing, and hacker history. I'm a vimmer and a devout arch
user. I have been known to be a free software evangelist.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see some of the projects I'm working on, check out my <a
    href="https://github.com/jkobyp">github.</a>
</br>
Particularly, <a href="https://github.com/timtadh/dynagrok"> dynagrok
</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkobyp/locavore"> locavore </a> may be of
interest. They're an object-state profiler and corresponding object-state based
fault-localizer for Go.
