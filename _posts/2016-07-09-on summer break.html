Well folks, I'm back in the states. I've been back for 7 months now, I've just
been too busy to tell you. Or lazy.

If you were wondering about my China bucket list, I managed to cross off "Eat
Stinky Tofu" and "Go to an arcade" before my plane took off that first Saturday
in January. I also completed my final exams (good on the whole!), and say
goodbye to many of the friends I had made there.
<p>
</p>
Before I left, I identified 3 changes I underwent in China that I wished would
stay with me after my transition home. First, there was my Chinese knowledge.
While I've done a really terrible job retaining my knowledge over the past 7
months, I did take a Chinese Cinema class and learned quite a bit more about the
culture and history of China through it. Furthermore, next semester I'll be back
in an actual Chinese class, and I'm hoping and hoping that this class will whip
me back into talking/listening/writing shape.
<p>
</p>
The second change that I wanted to retain was one of perspective. I know that
after returning to the U.S., my views have shifted right back into place on
internal issues - a strong stance against government surveillance and
infringement on social freedoms. About international issues though, I like to
think I still retain the benefit of being able to put myself in the shoes of a
European or Chinese person, a skill which I think I acquired by making diverse
friends and engaging in discussion with them.

<p>
The third change - my dreams. I'm comfortable saying that my wanderlust is not
gone, and the lessons I've learned about myself and what drives me have not been
forgotten.

It's been almost a year since I received my acceptance in the mail, and it's
been one of the most interesting years of my life. One of the most challenging,
yes, but well worth it.
