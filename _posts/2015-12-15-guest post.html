<h4> Some thoughts - Dad </h4>
<p>I wanted to share some thoughts about my trip to China earlier this month (Dec 1 - 8).
When Koby embarked on the process of making his way to China earlier this year,
I had no doubt that if he was accepted into either of his programs for the fall
semester (China or Hong Kong), I would be making a trip to Asia to visit.
As Debbie and I took the necessary steps to secure our travel visas, the anticipation
grew and before I knew it we were flying to PEK via DFW. The lengthy flight was
not as bad as I had anticipated, given the in-flight entertainment that was available.
</p>
<p>
We were fortunate to have Koby greet us at Beijing Capital International Airport,
as navigating our way to the Lakeview Hotel, which borders Peking University,
would have been an extreme adventure. Koby proved to be a masterful translator
and navigator throughout our stay in Beijing. Lucky for us, we were able to enjoy
Koby's company for all but a few hours during school days. Given the time difference
between Cleveland and Beijing (+13 hrs), we lost a day traveling to China
(departed Tues morning Dec 1 and arrived Wed afternoon Dec 2). We packed in a lot
of fun and interesting things during our 6 days here. In addition to the normal
tourist attractions we visited - the Great Wall of China, Forbidden City, Tiananmen
Square, site of the Beijing Olympics (2008), Beijing Night Market, etc - which were
awesome, highlights also included non-traditional activities - open-mic night at a
hip cafe, Koby's friend Hanna's dance competition at Beijing Union University, Karaoke
with Koby's class at MySong KTV, and exploring the City of Beijing via foot, subway and bus.
 </p>
 <p>
Despite a population totaling 12 million people, I felt very safe in all of my
activities - riding the subway and walking the city day and night. Passing through
security screenings were the norm for most major attractions as well as train and
subway travel. The food was delicious, plentiful and very inexpensive and we enjoyed
visiting small local restaurants which showcased regional flavors. Public transportation
was very efficient and made getting around easy. Many Western companies had a presence
in Beijing including 7-Eleven, KFC, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and Subway, but I was most
surprised to see a Papa Johns pizza shop. We did not partake in any of these Western
comforts but favored local cuisine. Shopping in Beijing ranged from upscale shopping
malls to street markets/vendors and everything in between.
</p>
<p>
It was great to meet Koby's roommate Adam (Australia) as well as his other friends
and classmates, who hail from across the globe. We had greeted Adam many times during
the semester while Skyping Koby, so it was nice to meet him in-person.
</p>
<p>
My 'once in a lifetime' China trip might not be, given that our travel visas are
good for 10 yrs. A self-imposed condition for future trips (Hong Kong, Shanghai, etc)
will be to learn more Chinese language. While I am thrilled to have Koby home next
month, I am happy that he had the opportunity to experience his semester in China.
A semester that has resulted in tremendous growth and maturation.
</p>
<p>
The highlight of my trip wasn't an event or attraction. It was all of it; it was
spending time with Koby; it was immersing myself in the Chinese culture and trying
to experience life as a local, not a Westerner.
</p>
<h4>Not on the bucket list - Mom</h4>
<p>
I want to be sure to write my thoughts about China before they fade away.  Its 1:30 in the
afternoon in Beijng but 12:30 am here. One of Koby’s friends, Hanna, asked
me what I considered the biggest culture shock about China.  I couldn’t answer her at the time,
but after thinking about it, I think culture shock is the wrong term.  It was more of an
“awakening”.  Although I don't consider myself a “judg-y” person, I definitely had many
preconceived ideas about China before I arrived, some emanating from high school, and we all
know how long ago that was.  I was only in Beijing a week but this I now know:
<ol>
<li>
The people of Beijing work very hard, whether its standing in the street for hours in the cold to
watch people pass, hauling large packages up multiple flights of stairs to tiny stands stuffed with
products, or cooking and serving patrons on an unheated street corner or restaurant.
</li>
<li>
Everything is well organized except the streets. The people must rebel on the streets,
creating a cacophony of bikes, cars, busses and pedestrians. They have no problem pushing
someone aside (without aggression) to get to where they want to go.
  </li><li>
The streets and hutongs (alleys) are safe day and night as were the subways and the buses.
</li><li>
According, at least, to what I observed, Chinese people eat little to no dairy
and consume white flour mian (noodles), mi fan (rice) and/or baozi (steamed buns)
each day, yet seemingly have strong bones and no increased risk of illness from the
carbs as our food police suggest.
</li>
<li>
The people of Beijing whom we encountered would like to be helpful but spoke
little to no English, although they gestured well.
</li>
<li>
The ancient sights such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall are too breathtaking to
describe in words. They are incomparable sights and only suggest the history of the dynasties
that created them.
</li>
<li>
And sadly…I am not of average size in China as I thought I would be. Chinese people vary in
height of course, but the majority are taller than I am.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
I was reluctant to go to China but am so grateful that I did.  Aside from seeing the sights, we
shared some of Koby’s life. He was the parent and we were the children, providing us with
guidance, security and safety as we explored the unknowns of China.
</p><p>
Thanks Koby!  We loved it!
