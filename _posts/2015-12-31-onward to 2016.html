There are only hours left in 2015. I think that making a big deal about a the
coming of January first is arbitrary, but I do a lot of arbitrary things so
let's just give in to the absurd, shall we? I'll take this time to discuss the
past week, what's up ahead, and also to reflect on my semester as a whole and my
thoughts of the future.
</p>
<p>
Adam and I had a nice Christmas last week - we celebrated by hosting a small
party in our room. The guest list evolved over time, until in the end, it was
just 9 of Adam's Chinese friends that arrived. It was quite fun! We played cards
and drank bourbon, and somehow ended up with more snacks and desserts than we
began the night with.
</p>
<p>
For those curious - Christmas is not a major holiday here in China, and is
considered mostly a Western celebration. Still, as with many western things, it
is appropriated and manifests in certain ways - you'll find some Christmas
decorations in the shopping malls, and particularly festive restaurants will add
a Santa hat to the uniform. While it wasn't quite the same as being back home,
Christmas spirit did show its face.
</p>
<p>
<b>Switching gears now </b>- today was my last day of classes. Now, I prepare for a
week of finals, then the plane home, and then back to the Case grind. The
closeness of my last day has become tangible. The feeling of An Ending is
manifesting. Earlier today I turned in an essay titled "我选择的改变" "The changes I
choose." Our assignment was to write an essay on how we've changed over the
semester, and I discussed the aspects of myself I believe have changed:
<ol>
    <li>My Chinese ability</li>
    <li>My perspective</li>
    <li>My life dream</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Yes, my Chinese has obviously improved since I've arrived. Besides this, my perspective on
many issues has a wider scope - having heard the opinions of my European
friends and experiencing Chinese culture for such a time, I'm certainly less
sure of myself on key political issues that my mind was made up on before. These
three changes are not the only ones I've experienced here - my identity has
changed in a number of ways that I can't percieve, let alone express - but these
are the changes that I have chosen for myself. Upon returning to the US, I know
that I'll be slipping back into old niches and picking up the old habits - this,
to me, is inevitable. As the effect of months here is gradually undone on me,
these are the vestiges which I hope for and will work toward maintaining.
</p>
<p>
The last one, my aspirations; that change comes more in the form of a
realization. When composing another essay on my dreams, I realized that I've
lived life so far on momentum alone, without pinpointing a dream to work toward.
The popular question to ask is, instead, what do you want to do with your life?
What career are you working toward? And to that, my answer would change from
month to month. I have ideas about what I want to do, but can that really count
as a dream? What's a dream without conviction? So, as I wrote some trifle about
my plan to go to graduate school, I realized that my real goal is much simpler
than that. To die happy, I thought, all I need is a comfortable enough life, and
some people to share it with. When I imagine myself nearing retirement age,
it turns out that a loving family is the only image that really puts a smile on my face.
</p>
<p>
And this realization comes none too soon. To my family I shall return! I just
need to get through finals week first.
