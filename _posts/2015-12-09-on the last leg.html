Hi people!
</p>
<p>
It's been nearly a hundred days since I've arrived here. I'd say that's quite a
milestone. And with only about 4 weeks left before it's time to head home,
the goodbyes, reflections, and final bucket-list items will begin.
</p>
<p>
So what have I done lately? Well, most recently, my parents have come to visit.
We explored all sorts of places around Beijing, including The Great Wall at
Badaling, Tian'an'men square and the Forbidden City, Wangfujing, a clothing
market, and even the Olympic village. It was really nice to have them come to
visit - I don't think any of us would have ever expected them to set foot in China
during their lifetimes - and I can't wait to see them again when I come home
next month.
</p>
<p>
And for the future? Well, I have one more trip coming up this weekend - to a
northern city called Chengde. The final exam grind is almost around the corner, and
I have a couple more things on my bucket list. My goals are thus:
<ol>
    <li> Eat stinky tofu </li>
    <li> Go to an arcade or internet cafe </li>
    <li> Check out Chengde </li>
    <li> Check out the 798 Art District </li>
    <li> Stay out way too late at the bar called Dada </li>
</ol>
As I complete each one, if it's noteworthy, I'll write about it and inform you
all how it went in detail. Hopefully I'll complete them all in the next four
weeks - wish me luck!
</p>
