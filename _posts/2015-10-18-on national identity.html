    Day 38. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a post about political and national identity. It's kind of
    boring, so you can skip it if you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two nights ago, I went out with an Italian, an Australian, and a
    Korean. Passing by a Japanese style open-air restaurant, we
    decided to sit down with a decanter of luke-warm Sake, and, as our Korean
    friend assures us is tradition, a nice hot bowl of pork-bone
    soup. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Yesterday, I woke up at 8:00am to meet up with a Chinese girl that
    was born and raised in Germany, another Korean that was studying
    at Columbia, and a girl from Hong Kong. We took a taxi to the foot
    of Xiang Shan, or Fragrant Hill, stopped into a mom-and-pop
    restaurant for breakfast (noodle-soup and boiled dumplings), and
    began to ascend the mountain.

    As an American in China, you begin to realize that the world is
    wider than you may first have guessed. You could be talking to
    your Italian friend, who knows that America is an imperialist
    bully; or you could be listening to your Chinese taxi driver,
    who admires America's power and technological advances, while
    acknowledging that with it came the displacement of dirty industry
    over to China. It makes me question assumptions I didn't even
    realize set me apart from others. It makes me question American
    Exceptionalism, isolationism, and even statehood as a fundamental
    concept. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I've called myself an American all my life, but I've never really
    had to stand up to that assertion because I've never truly
    encountered the Other. Well, now that I'm here in Beijing, living,
    dining, and playing soccer with representatives from Scotland,
    Italy, Germany, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Chile, India, China,
    Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea; only now, for the first time, am
    I coming in contact with what it actually means to be American.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what does it mean? Well, I can't really say. I'm still in the
    process of getting to know what it mean to be American. It's
    confusing to me, and I think it will take a while to work out. I
    do, however, know some of the implications. The first - that it
    means a lot less than you might think - American Exceptionalism is
    a concept that I've never consciously bought into, but the extent
    of its ludicrousness is now rendered into sharp relief. Another
    implication of being an American, is that you'll travel to far
    fewer foreign countries than an average european; and if you do
    travel, you'll probably realize that your education didn't waste a
    single lesson teaching the history of the country you visited. It
    means that the vast majority of Americans that attempt each day to
    solve our country's problems will never be capable of doing so
    with any sort of perspective. It also means you've
    grown up in an area with safe and cheap drinking water that comes
    out of your tap, and that you've probably never worried that the
    things you say on Facebook could get you thrown in prison.

    It's been a while since I've checked in with you, so I wanted to
    invite you in to listen to what's been stewing inside my head
    these few days. As I've said, I'm still not sure what to make of
    this whole Being American thing - if you have any thoughts on it,
    feel free to let me know.
