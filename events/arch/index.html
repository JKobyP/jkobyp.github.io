            <h2>Welcome to my personal site!</h2>
            <p>
            I'm Koby Picker, a student of Computer Science and Chinese at Case
            Western Reserve University. I like computers, swing-dancing, juggling,
            gardening, and baking bread.<br/><br/>

          <h2>About me</h2>
	  <h3>I love computers</h3>
          <p>
            I've been fascinated with computers since I was young, and bought my first book on
	    "vista for dummies" when I was 12. Now, I'm an avid linux user and a proponent of free software,
	    I participate in computer science research, and have my hand in a number of projects
	    (some personal, some established open-source).<br/><br/>
          </p>
	  <h3>I love Chinese</h3>
	  <p>
	    I've been studying Chinese for about three years, now, and I'm spending a semester in China
	    for fall of 2015. I find the language and the culture to be fascinating, and as any good Chinese
	    citizen can tell you, China has over five thousand years of history. You can follow my adventures at
	    <a href="Blog/index.html"> my travel blog</a>. <br><br>
	  </p>
	  <h3>I love other things too</h3>	  
	  <p>
	    I'm a sourdough enthusiast, with a homemade starter culture born in Summer of 2014. I'm a juggler with the
	    well-loved Case juggling club. Lastly, if this whole Computer Science thing doesn't end up working out,
	    you can probably find me on a homestead somewhere, tending to an organic farm. Though I haven't yet, you'll likely
	    see me post photos of my bread, my juggling, and my garden in a relevant section of my blog.
